imported. The project has only one class MLP.java. The letter_recognition.data
file bundled in the project.

The code has three methods in main mathod:
nn.trainXOR();   //call to XOR trainer
nn.trainSin();   // call to sin trainer
nn.letterRecognition();   //call to UCI dataset letter recognition trainer

Any two calls can be commented to run the third.

The MLP.java source is present inside MLP_Project\src\mlp\logic 
folder in the project folder.

Note: MLP.java can be run as a standalone program. Just need to provide for letter_recognition.data file and package name 'package mlp.logic' should be removed
which is present at the top in MLP.java program.
